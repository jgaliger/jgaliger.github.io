        <h2>ITIS 3135 Website Evaluations</h2>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://weirdorconfusing.com/">First Website</a></h3>
                <p>This website is very interesting as it seems like it was made as a joke website, however, it follows the CRAP principals really well. Within the webiste, I noticed that they had extremely good contrast and also proximity.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: The contrast they used in this website was not just white and black text. There was actually quite a few changes in background color, with cool patters along with it.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: Repetition was really good as with the items being sold, each item was portrayed in a very similar manner.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: The alignment swithced up quite a bit, but most pictures and texts were very well aligned.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Every picture was very closely related, and they were grouped together by subject</li>
                </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://binarypiano.com/">Second Website</a></h3>
                <p>This website was pretty terrible. There seemed to be no contrast, there was just a simple set of numbers on the screen that changed quickly. There was not a lot of content.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: No contrast, the only colors there were white and black.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: There was repetition, the sounds that the binary piano repeated until it got tiring very quickly </li>
                    <li>Alignment: There was alignment, the binary numbers were centered.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: There was not enough content for proximity.</li>
                </ul>
